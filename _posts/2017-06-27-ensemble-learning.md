Three approaches to combine several machine learning models into one predictive model in order to decrease the variance (bagging), bias (boosting) or improving the predictive force (stacking alias ensemble). But first, what are bias and variance?

### Bias


### Variance

### Bagging
(stands for **B**ootstrap **Agg**regation)

### Boosting

### Stacking
