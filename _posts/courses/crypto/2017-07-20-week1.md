### Ciphers
include a Decryption and Encryption algorithm
- can only have **perfect secrecy** if the key is at least as long as the message.

### Stream Ciphers
- do not have perfect secrecy
#### PRG (Pseudo Random Generator)
- must be **unpredictable** which means that there DNE an "efficient" algorithm that can predict bits i+1 of G(key) when given the first i bits of G(key) for non-negligible \\( \epsilon \\)
