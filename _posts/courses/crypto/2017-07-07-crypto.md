### Hash Functions  

Crypto Hash Functions must have these following properties:
* collision-free: If H(x) = H(y), it is safe to assume that x = y
* binding: Given H(y), it is infeasible to find y.
* puzzle-friendly: There is no faster way to find x from H(x) than brute force

The hash function that Bitcoin is using is called SHA-256.

### Hash pointers
Instead of storing pointers to the data, we store the hash values of those pointers as that helps detect tampering 
Implemented with Merkle tree that can verify non-members in O(log n) time

### Digital signatures

* must be unique for each document even for the same signee
* verifiable
* cannot be forged
* one is enough for entire document even when broken up into blocks
* only as good as the source of randomness
* Bitcoin uses ECDSA standard.

### Stream Ciphers

SSL/TLS are protocols.

Use encryption algorithms that are publicly known as they have already been tested thoroughly.

Proof of knowing p, q that p*q = N without giving away the values of p and q


### Ciphers
include a Encryption and Decryption algorithm
- can only have **perfect secrecy** if the key is at least as long as the message.

### Stream Ciphers
- do not have perfect secrecy
#### PRG (Pseudo Random Generator)
- must be **unpredictable** which means that there DNE an "efficient" algorithm that can predict bits i+1 of G(key) when given the first i bits of G(key) for non-negligible \\( \epsilon \\)
