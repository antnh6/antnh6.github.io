This is my notes for ENGL 101B (online) taken in Winter 2018.

## Gorgias - Classical Rhetoric and Sophistry
- refer to Encomium of Helen
- Longstanding prejudice against Rhetoric is that it is deceptive. Plato thinks that sophistry is not only wrong but intentionally deceptive. In a way Gorgias reaffirms this prejudice by saying "All who have and do persuade people of things do so by molding a false argument." Language is an artificial and artistic human construction which is different from the thing to which it refers.
- Main focus: Rhetoric <--> Knowledge  Opinion
- Opinion 
    - 3 examples of power of persuasion:
        - Philosophy
- Speech as a drug:
    - refer to section 14
    - the analogy of drugs and words; speech = active substance that transforms the mind like drugs transform the body
    - ambivalent nature of rhetoric in its usuage, i.e. can be harmful and beneficial
    - rhetoric is about timing, place, audience and circumstance collectively called the opportunate moment (*kairos*)
- Speech as toxin (*Othelleo*)
- Seeing and Hearing:
    - refer to sections 15 and 17
    - We do not see what we want, but what confronts us.
    - Gorgias says that the spoken word leaves traces upon the soul.
    - Hamlet: the soul is a kind of encryption surface upon which speech leaves its traces.
