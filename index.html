 I am currently in my third year of <strong> Computer Science </strong> at the University of Waterloo. I also minor in <i>CO</i> and <i>Statistics</i> for good measure.

- My strongest suit atm is <strong>C++</strong> which I learnt by writing a toy assembler and a compiler and by building a Tetris game. To improve, I am also solving problems on Hackerrank and Leetcode. Check out my solutions <a href="https://github.com/antnh6/leetcode-my-solutions">here</a>. 
<br>
- Since the past year I've become interested in <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, hence my decision to devote this 4-month Summer to learning the fundamental concepts, putting them to work by making some projects in <strong>Python/R</strong>, and if time allows, joining a Kaggle competition by September.
<br>
- My <a href="https://medium.com/@antnh6"><strong>blog</strong></a> is where I will document my journey of learning ML from square one. I'll try to update my progress every week and give my opinion on which resource is useful, and worth spending your time on.

Inspired by many great bloggers, I decided to keep a <a href="http://annwin.me/todolist"><strong>TODO list</strong></a> which is an ever-growing list of things I want to do while I'm still breathing and kicking, be it in any area of my life. Having this list out in the open sort of encourages me to go out more, get stuff done and report back. I'm already excited making this list.

Grew up in <i>Vietnam</i>, I moved to <i>the States</i> at 18, alternated between working and studying <i>Biochemistry</i> before crossing the border to get serious with CS in <i>Waterloo, Canada</i>. During that time, I've also had a few opportunities to window-shop, taste some yummy food and make some friends in Japan, Korea, China, and Thailand.

<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span> In my free time, you will most likely catch me:
- coming up with mnemonics to learn new words on <a href="http://annwin.me/todolist"><strong>Memrise</strong></a>
- watching thriller <strong>films</strong>. I'm more than halfway finishing Top 100 IMDB. 
<br>
- playing with my <strong>dogs</strong> or teaching them tricks, so we can show off at dog parks for treats. They are not only crazy photogenic but also top-of-the-line adorable IRL. Here's one of my favorite photos of them.
<br>
- making several attempts at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/an.nwin/"><strong>cooking</strong></a>.
