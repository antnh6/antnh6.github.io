I am currently studying <strong> Computer Science </strong> and <strong>Combinatorics/Optimization</strong> at the University of Waterloo.

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
- My <a href="/notes"><strong>interests</strong></a> lie mostly in AI and Machine Learning, specifically in Reinforcement Learning atm. I'm working on a project (yet to be published) that teaches machines to play Pacman. Some of my past <a href="https://github.com/antnh6"><strong>projects</strong></a> can be found here.
<br>
- I'm most comfortable coding in <strong>C++ and Python</strong> which I got better from writing a toy assembler and a compiler and by building a game similar to Tetris called Quadris.

Inspired by many great bloggers, I decided to keep a <a href="/todo"><strong>TODO list</strong></a> which is an ever-growing list of things I want to do while I'm still breathing and kicking, be it in any area of my life. Having this list out in the open will hopefully hold me accountable for my own words and encourage me to get stuff done and report back.

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span> In my free time, you will most likely catch me:
<br>
- coming up with mnemonics to learn new words on <a href="https://www.memrise.com/user/antnh6/"><strong>Memrise</strong></a>.
<br>
- making several attempts at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BUNV7MnhXJV/?taken-by=an.nwin"><strong>cooking</strong></a>.
<br>
- teaching my <strong>top-of-the-line-adorable-IRL dogs</strong> tricks, so we can show off at dog parks for treats :D.
<br>
- making a dent in the <strong>TOP 250 IMDb</strong>.
