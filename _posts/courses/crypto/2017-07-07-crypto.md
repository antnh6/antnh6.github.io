### Hash Functions  

Crypto Hash Functions must have these following properties:
* collision-free: If H(x) = H(y), it is safe to assume that x = y
* binding: Given H(y), it is infeasible to find y.
* puzzle-friendly: There is no faster way to find x from H(x) than brute force

The hash function that Bitcoin is using is called SHA-256.

### Hash pointers
Instead of storing pointers to the data, the hash pointers help detect tampering 
Implemented with Merkle tree that can verify non-members in O(log n) time

### Digital signatures

* must be unique for each document even for the same signee
* verifiable
* cannot be forged
* one is enough for entire document even when broken up into blocks
* only as good as the source of randomness
* Bitcoin uses ECDSA standard.
