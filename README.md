Resources I used to make this blog using Jekyll, and Github Pages:

- For the theme: http://deanattali.com
- To set up my custom domain with a DNS provider: 
    - http://mycyberuniverse.com/web/configuring-a-godaddy-domain-name-with-github-pages.html
    - https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/
    - https://pages.github.com/
- This tutorial: https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-jekyll-theme--cms-26332
- Disqus and Google Analytics accounts to keep track of my stalkers, jk viewers :)
  
The entire process took me 2 days, but most of the people from the blogs that I've read got it done in less than 24 hrs, so be optimistic.
