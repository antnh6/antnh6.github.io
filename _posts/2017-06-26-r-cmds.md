R is indexed 1.

* read.csv()
* summary()
    * also used to see the # of NA's
* str()
* table() 
    * when 2 args are used, first will be listed on the left, second on top
* dev.copy (extension, fileName)

  dev.off()
* hist()
* boxplot(oneFeature ~ anotherFeature)
* sort(table)
* Top2 = **subset**(mvt, LocationDescription=="ALLEY" | LocationDescription=="GAS STATION")) OR
    * Top5 = subset(mvt, LocationDescription **%in%** c("STREET", "ALLEY"))
* **factor**() to get rid of unnecessary factors
* plot (x,y) 
    * type"l" to get smooth graph
    * col = "red"
    * colors() to get all possible values for argument 'col'
    * lty=2 to get different type of line
* lines() to add line to existing graph
* abline(v=as.Date(c(someDate)), lwd=someNum) to pinpoint on existing Graph
    * lwd is for line thickness
* tapply(1stArg, 2ndArg, function) sort by 2ndArg, then apply function on 1stArg
    * Ex:
    sort(tapply(CPS$Education == "No high school diploma", CPS$MetroArea, mean, na.rm=TRUE)) will return proportion of interviewees from each metropolitan area who have not received a high school diploma, ignoring missing values
* **ctrl+L** to clear console
* is.na(column)
* mean(c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSe)) gives 0.75
* Convert code to values by connecting 2 dataframes
    *Ex: combined = merge(CPS,MetroAreaMap, by.x="MetroAreaCode",by.y="Code",all.x=TRUE). Last arg is to keep all rows from CPS as NAs even if there is no match.
* **jitter()** 
    * adds or subtracts a small amount of random noise to the values passed to it, and two runs will yield different results correct
* lm(thingToPredict ~ IndependentVar1 + IndependentVar2, data=source)
    * predict(modelName, testSet)
* residuals = errors
* cor(variable1, variable) to calculate the correlation between two variables
    * cor(dataset) to see correlation between any two variables of the dataset
