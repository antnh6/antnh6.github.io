I am currently studying <strong> Computer Science </strong> and <strong>Statistics</strong> at the University of Waterloo.

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
- I'm most comfortable coding in <strong>C++</strong> which I got better from writing a toy assembler and a compiler and by building a game similar to Tetris called Quadris. I also try to make it a habit to practice on Leetcode. Check out my progress <a href="https://github.com/antnh6/leetcode-my-solutions">here</a>. 
<br>
- I devote this Summer to learn more about <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. All of the related <a href="https://github.com/antnh6/titanic_survival_exploration"><strong>projects</strong></a> are written in either <strong>Python</strong> or <strong>R</strong>. I also keep a <a href="https://medium.com/@antnh6"><strong>blog</strong></a> to document my learning progress from square one.

Inspired by many great bloggers, I decided to keep a <a href="/todo"><strong>TODO list</strong></a> which is an ever-growing list of things I want to do while I'm still breathing and kicking, be it in any area of my life. Having this list out in the open will hopefully hold me accountable for my own words and encourage me to get stuff done and report back. I’ve already had a lot of fun putting this list together .

Grew up in <i>Vietnam</i>, I moved to <i>the States</i> at 18, alternated between working and studying <i>Biochemistry</i> before crossing the border to get <em>serious</em> with CS in <i>Waterloo, Canada</i>. During that time, I've also had a few opportunities to window-shop, taste some yummy food and make some friends in Japan and Thailand.

<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span> In my free time, you will most likely catch me:
<br>
- coming up with mnemonics to learn new words on <a href="https://www.memrise.com/user/antnh6/"><strong>Memrise</strong></a>.
<br>
- making several attempts at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BUNV7MnhXJV/?taken-by=an.nwin"><strong>cooking</strong></a>.
<br>
- teaching my <strong>top-of-the-line-adorable-IRL dogs</strong> tricks, so we can show off at dog parks for treats :D.
<br>
- making a dent in the <strong>TOP 250 IMDb</strong>.
