I am currently in my third year of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo. I also minor in CO and Stats in which I plan to take Convex Optimization and Nonlinear Optimization since I heard they are useful for ML. Will report back with my own opinion.

My strongest suit atm is <strong>C++</strong> which I've improved by writing a toy assembler and compiler, building a Tetris game, and doing one problem a day on Hackerrank. Check out <a href="https://github.com/antnh6">my projects</a>. 
In the past year I've become interested in Machine Learning, thus explaining my decision to devote this 4-month Summer to learn the fundamental concepts, make some projects in Python/R, if possible, join a Kaggle competition by September.

I'm addicted to <strong>thriller</strong> films that keep one up way past their bedtime perusing over minor details on Reddit. Here is a few of my all-time favorites: BB, BCS, HoC, The Office, Oldboy, and The Prestige. (You'd know these acronyms if you watched them :D)
I also love playing with my dogs and teaching them tricks, so we can show off at dog parks(jk!).
I can cook a mean padthai and make bubble tea with tapioca balls from scratch. You can see my attemps at cooking <a href="https://www.instagram.com/an.nwin/">here</a>.

The <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> page is intended to be a place where I document my journey of learning ML from square one. I'll try to update my progress every week. If you'd like us to be study buddies or have any questions for me, I can be reached on any of these social media platforms.

Grew up in <i>Vietnam</i>, moved to <i>the States</i> at 18 by myself, alternated between working and studying <i>Biochemistry</i> before crossing the border to get serious with CS in <i>Waterloo, Canada</i>. During that time, I've also had a few opportunities to window-shop and taste yummy food in Japan, Korea, China, and Thailand.
