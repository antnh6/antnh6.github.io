- **Dog Breed Detector** - Implemented a *CNN* using *Keras* on an *AWS GPU* to identify dog breed or the most resembling dog breed detected in a given image of either a dog or a human with 84% accuracy.

- **Grouping customers** - In this project, I employed unsupervised ML algorithms PCA, GMM and some pre-processing tools to group customers into clusters based on their annual spending amounts on 6 categories.

- **Predicting potential donors** - In this project, I employed three supervised learning models to predict whether a person is making over $50k a year, thus be a potential donor to a non-profit.

- **This website** - Built with Jekyll, JavaScript and Markdown, this website is the home for my projects, and notes on topics I have been learning outside of school. I hope it also gives you some glimpses into my personality (e.g. I adore the color purple).
