My name is An Nguyen. I have the following qualities:

- I can code, and have every intention to make it my career. 
- I have a knack for picking great movies and TV shows. To name a few of my all-time favorites: Breaking Bad, The Office, and The Prestige
- Dogs love me, and I can teach them cool tricks.
- I can cook some mean padthai, and make bubble tea with real milk, not the powdery yuckiness they concoct in stores.

What else do you need?

Probably a lot more, but come on, 7 billion people on this Planet and you just happen to stumble into my blog? Let's be friends for now, homie.
