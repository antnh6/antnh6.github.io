 I am currently in my third year of <strong> Computer Science </strong> at the University of Waterloo. I also minor in <i>CO</i> and <i>Statistics</i> since I am an eager beaver when it comes to learning Math.

- My strongest suit atm is <strong>C++</strong> which I learnt by writing a toy assembler and a compiler and by building a Tetris game. To improve, I am also solving problems on Hackerrank and Leetcode. Check out <a href="https://github.com/antnh6">my Projects</a>. 
<br>
- In the past year I've become interested in <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, hence my decision to devote this 4-month Summer to learning the fundamental concepts, putting them to work by making some projects in <strong>Python/R</strong>, and if time allows, joining a Kaggle competition by September.
<br>
- My <a href="https://medium.com/@antnh6"><strong>blog</strong></a> is where I will document my journey of learning ML from square one. I'll try to update my progress every week and give my opinion on which resource is useful, and worth spending your time on. If you'd like us to be study buddies or have any questions for me, I can be reached on any social media below in the footer.

Inspired by many great bloggers, I decided to keep a <a href="annwin.me/todolist"><strong>TODO list</strong></a> where I write down all the things I want to get done while I'm still breathing and kicking, be it in any area of my life, go do them, and report back. I'm already excited making this list.

Grew up in <i>Vietnam</i>, I moved to <i>the States</i> at 18, alternated between working and studying <i>Biochemistry</i> before crossing the border to get serious with CS in <i>Waterloo, Canada</i>. During that time, I've also had a few opportunities to window-shop and taste some yummy food in Japan, Korea, China, and Thailand.

- I'm quite addicted to <strong>thriller films</strong>, the type that keeps one up way past their bedtime perusing over minor details on Reddit trying to tie up loose ends. Here is a few of my all-time favorites: BB, BCS, HoC, The Office, Oldboy, and The Prestige.
<br>
- I also love playing with my <strong>dogs</strong> and teaching them tricks, so we can show off at dog parks for treats. In the photo above, from left to right are Ot, Bear, and Dragon.
<br>
- I can also cook a mean padthai and make tapioca balls for bubble tea from scratch. You can see my attemps at <strong>cooking</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/an.nwin/">here</a>.
