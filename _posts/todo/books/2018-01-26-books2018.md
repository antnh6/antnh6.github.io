Growing up I almost NEVER read for pleasure. Unless you count comics, then I probably read voraciously for a year before high school started, or me going broke from having to pay overdue renting fees to my local comics shops; whichever came first.

However, I am planning to change this fact about myself. Here are the 26 books I am planning to read in 2018. Hopefully with the pace being reasonably set at 1 book every 2 weeks, I will be able to stay on track and finish this challenge. Let's go!
