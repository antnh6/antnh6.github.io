 I am currently in my third year of <strong> Computer Science </strong> at the University of Waterloo. I also minor in <i>CO</i> and <i>Statistics</i> since there is no such thing as too much Math (kidding, our school has a very strong Math Department, and I'd love to learn more about the field).

My strongest suit atm is <strong>C++</strong> which I learnt by writing a toy assembler and a compiler and by building a Tetris game. To improve, I am also doing one problem a day on Hackerrank. Check out <a href="https://github.com/antnh6">my projects</a>.

In the past year I've become interested in <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, hence my decision to devote this 4-month Summer to learning the fundamental concepts, putting them to work by making some projects in <strong>Python/R</strong>, and if time allows, joining a Kaggle competition by September.

I'm addicted to <strong>thriller films</strong>, the type that keeps one up way past their bedtime perusing over minor details on Reddit trying to tie loose ends (^^!). Here is a few of my all-time favorites: BB, BCS, HoC, The Office, Oldboy, and The Prestige. (You'd know these acronyms if you watched them :D)
<br>
I also love playing with my <strong>dogs</strong> and teaching them tricks, so we can show off at dog parks (joking!). In the photo above, from left to right are Ot, Bear, and Dragon.
<br>
I can cook a mean padthai and make bubble tea with tapioca balls from scratch. You can see my attemps at <strong>cooking</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/an.nwin/">here</a>.

The <strong>blog</strong> is intended to be a place where I document my journey of learning ML from square one. I'll update my progress every week and give my opinion on which resource is useful, and worth spending time on. If you'd like us to be study buddies or have any questions for me, I can be reached on any social media below in the footer.

Grew up in <i>Vietnam</i>, moved to <i>the States</i> at 18, alternated between working and studying <i>Biochemistry</i> before crossing the border to get serious with CS in <i>Waterloo, Canada</i>. During that time, I've also had a few opportunities to window-shop and taste yummy food in Japan, Korea, China, and Thailand.
