**In dire need of updating**

I have compiled below a list of resources relevant to ML, AI, and the whole shebang with the goal of getting through them gradually, one by one. 

I am planning to sort the list in order of increasing difficulty, i.e. the order that I will take them in the near future and put an asterisk next to the courses I'm taking.
