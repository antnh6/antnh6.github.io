- **Dog Breed Detector** - I implemented a CNN with AWS GPU to classify dog breeds or the most resembling dog breed among 133 available breeds when given as input an image of either a dog or a human.

- **Grouping customers** - In this project, I employed two unsupervised ML algorithms PCA, GMM and some pre-processing tools to group customers into clusters based on their annual spending amounts on 6 categories.

- **Predicting potential donors** - In this project, I employed several supervised learning models to predict whether a person is making over $50k a year, thus be a potential donor to a non-profit.

- **This website** - Built with Jekyll, JavaScript and Markdown, this website is meant to be a home for my projects, and notes on topics I learn on the side. I hope it also gives you some glimpses into who/how I am as a person based on my interests (e.g. I love the color purple, hah!)

- **Compiler** - I built a scanner, a parser, and a compiler all in C++ for a small language similar to C++ called WLP4.
